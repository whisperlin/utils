# How to use
Create Icosahedron Sphere and UV Sphere in one click in Unity.

To use it, add this folder to your Assets folder of your unity project. Then just add the SphereMesher.cs script to an empty gameobject and "poof!", magic happens!

On the inspector you can select if you want an Icosahedron Sphere or a UV Sphere as well as setting the size and resolution. Then press "generate" to update the mesh. The mesh will be generated from scratch on play.

Hope you find this useful.
