Description

 Amplify Impostors is a small but powerful tool that allows the creation of different
 types of Impostors, which are substitutes of complex high polycount objects made from flat
 and simple polygons, that render a fake version of the original object (hence the name). 
 Much like traditional sprites, they usually consist of a single flat quad polygon or simple
 polygonal shapes and, like classic billboards, always face the camera. Think of them as a
 camera facing cardboard version of the object you want to render. The common purpose of
 using such technique is to be able to represent far distant objects with a very low
 polycount, for instance, trees, bushes, rocks, ruins, buildings, props, etc.
